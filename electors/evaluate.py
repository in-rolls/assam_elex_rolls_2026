"""Scoring an engine against what the page actually says.

Everything else in this stage measures agreement, coverage or self-consistency, because no
labelled data exists. That was a real limit and it hid a real problem: the name field sat at
"91.5% present and not provably wrong" for the whole of this stage's development, and when a
second engine finally made comparison possible, the two disagreed on 59% of names. Reading the
crops settled which was right, and it was not the first pass.

So this is the small piece of genuine ground truth: a random sample of boxes, cropped and read
by eye, scored per field. Sixteen boxes across four parts is not a benchmark -- it is enough to
tell a 0% from a 90%, which is what the numbers turned out to need.

**Sampled at random, never from the disagreements.** Scoring the subset where two engines differ
measures that subset. The first version of this comparison did exactly that and would have
reported the disagreement rate as the error rate.
