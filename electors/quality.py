"""How good the extracted fields actually are, without ground truth.

Every quality figure quoted for this stage until now was a **fill rate** -- whether the field
came back non-empty. ``epic=83%`` says 83% of rows have something in the EPIC column. It says
nothing about whether that something is the elector's EPIC, and an 83% fill is equally
consistent with 83% correct and 40% correct.

There is no labelled data here, so accuracy cannot be measured directly. It can be
**bracketed**, which is worth more than another fill rate:

**Lower bound -- values that cannot be right.** An Assamese name does not contain Latin
letters. An elector's own name is not identical to their father's. An EPIC does not repeat
within a constituency. Each of these is certainly an error, so their combined rate is a floor
under the true error rate.

**Upper bound -- disagreement.** Names are read at two scales and compared; where two
independent passes produce the same string the value is very unlikely to be wrong. The
disagreement rate is therefore a ceiling.

**And two fields do have real ground truth**, which is why they are reported apart from the
bracket rather than mixed into it. The roll's closing page publishes its own male/female
split and its own total, so the sex ratio and completeness can be checked outright. That is
not a nicety: fill rate showed sex at a healthy 87% while it was running 44.2% male against a
published 51%, and only the ratio caught it.

**Distributions catch what neither bound sees.** A per-row check cannot notice that ages
ending in one digit are over-represented, but the model doubles digits it is unsure of --
``55`` read as ``525`` -- so systematic digit confusion shows up in the histogram and nowhere
else.
