"""Packing the text tighter, because Cloud Vision charges by the image.

A rendered page is 15.5 MP and **30% of it is text**. The rest is photo placeholders, ruled
borders, page margins and the white space under the last line of every box. Vision bills per
image submitted rather than per page, so those pixels are the bill: four pages fit in one image
as rendered, and fourteen fit once the dead space is gone -- $345 for the state against $99.

This is the same idea that just failed for dots.ocr, and it should work here for a different
reason. dots.ocr broke on a 776x70 strip because 11:1 is a shape nothing in its training looks
like: it looped on 76% of crops and switched script on a third. Vision is a detector and
recogniser, not a generative model -- no token cap to run into, no script to hallucinate -- and
it already reads four-page composites. **The risk here is not that it reads worse. It is that a
word comes back attributed to the wrong box**, which is a plausible answer with nothing raised.

So every tile's rectangle in the composite is recorded, and words are assigned by that rectangle
on both axes. Two tiles side by side never share a word even if Vision groups them into one
visual line, because the filter is geometric and not a reading-order guess.
