"""Proving the repack is right, rather than assuming it.

The composites are what Cloud Vision is billed for and what every extracted row derives from, so
"the packing is correct" cannot rest on having looked at a contact sheet. Two failures matter and
neither announces itself:

- **a tile lost**, so an elector who is plainly printed never reaches the output
- **a tile misplaced**, so a name comes back attributed to somebody else's row

Both are checkable exactly, because stage one records two rectangles for every tile: where it was
cut from the page (``manifest.jsonl``) and where it landed in the composite (``placements.json``).
Cropping the composite at the second must give **byte-identical pixels** to cropping the
re-rendered page at the first. Nothing about that is statistical -- it either matches or it names
the tile that does not.
