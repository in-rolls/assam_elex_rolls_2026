"""What the failures have in common, and what to try about it.

Every root cause found in this stage so far came from dumping pages and staring at them:
*all five boxes with no age line were male*; *six of seven EPIC misses came back empty and one
had a stray slash*; *the failures cluster in the rightmost column*. Each of those was a
**co-occurrence** -- a failure class lining up with an observable feature -- and noticing them
by eye does not scale and does not repeat.

So this looks for them directly. For each failure class it asks which feature of a row
predicts it, and reports the ones where the failure rate is far above base rate. That is the
same signal I was reading off the page dumps, computed instead of noticed.

**It proposes; it does not conclude.** A strong association is a hypothesis about where to
look, and the hypothesis still has to survive `bench` -- in-sample, out-of-sample, no
degradation, cost. The point is to stop the search depending on which page happened to be
opened, not to skip the validation that follows.

Worked example, from the real bug: with `sex` as the failure class and `box_col` as the
feature, the age-line failures sat overwhelmingly in one column. With `sex` against the
*value of another field*, they were all male. Either would have pointed at the line-finding
code in one step.
