"""Bringing constituencies home, and re-judging them once they arrive.

The rows live in a bucket that is meant to be deleted when the run is over. So what comes home
has to stand on its own -- usable without the cloud, and **checkable** without it either.

Three things travel, and the reasons differ:

- **the shard**, which is the product. 3-7 MB; the whole state is about 700 MB.
- **the verification bundle**, a few kilobytes of printed totals and box counts, so the verdict
  can be recomputed here rather than believed. Re-judging from ``stage1`` would mean pulling
  412 MB a constituency, and pulling fifty gigabytes to check seven hundred megabytes is the
  wrong shape -- but more to the point, ``stage1`` is one of the things being deleted.
- **the Vision words**, ~120 MB a constituency, which are the only artefact that cost money.
  $148 to re-read for the state. Composites, renders and rows are CPU we can spend again; the
  words are not. With them here the bucket becomes disposable and a better parser costs nothing.

**The SHA-256 is checked before a shard is accepted.** A truncated download is otherwise a
silently short constituency, and silently short is exactly what this project keeps producing.

**The verdict is recomputed, not copied.** The machine that produced a constituency is not a
witness to its own correctness.
