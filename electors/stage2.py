"""Stage two: the only step that costs money, and nothing else.

Stage one already rendered the part, found the boxes, read the EPICs and packed the text into
composites. This stage submits those composites to Cloud Vision and puts the words back in the
rows they came from. It never opens the source PDF.

That is the whole point of the split. ``vision_part.read_repacked`` does both halves in one pass,
which means re-running Vision -- after a parser change, or with a second engine -- re-renders 121
pages of PDF and re-runs tesseract over every box to get back to pixels that are already sitting
on disk. Here the composites are the input, so a second reading costs the API call and nothing
else.

The join is the load-bearing part. Vision answers in each **composite's** coordinates, and a word
in tile 200 has to come back to box 200 of page 14. ``placements.json`` holds every tile's
rectangle and ``repack.words_for`` assigns by that rectangle on both axes, so two tiles side by
side never share a word even when Vision groups them into one visual line. That the rectangles
are right is not assumed: ``electors.verify`` compares every tile's pixels against the source
page, and on the first five parts of AC1 all 2,964 were byte-identical.
