"""Re-reading the boxes the cheap pass could not, with a model that can.

Tesseract loses the house number on a third of boxes and the age on a fifth, and the line cache
showed why: the crop yields no digits at all, so no parser change recovers them. savitr's
distilled Surya reads the same crops -- on one page it took the house number from 14 of 30 to
29 and the age from 21 to 29.

**It is also right where the two disagree.** On the seven ages both engines read differently,
tesseract gave 92, 92, 85 and 96 while Surya gave 59, 52, 25 and 61. That is the same excess of
nonagenarians the age distribution had already flagged as an artefact -- 220 rows in the
nineties against 126 in the seventies -- so the disagreement is not a coin toss between two
opinions, it is one engine reproducing a known defect and the other not.

It costs 2-6 seconds a box against tesseract's 1.7, depending on what else the machine is
doing, which is why this runs on flagged rows rather than on everything.

**One call per box is not an oversight; it is the only thing that works.** The obvious saving
is to answer for several electors per call, and it was measured two ways and failed both:

- *Stacking crops into one tile.* The model returns exactly one record however many boxes are
  in the image -- 6 ages from 12 boxes at two per call, 3 from 12 at four per call, 2 from 12
  at six. The extra boxes are simply ignored, so the saving is imaginary.
- *Keeping the roll's own layout* -- a whole grid column, or three columns of four rows. These
  run away instead: 13 ages from 10 boxes, then 0, then 12, then 0, every one of them stopped
  by the token cap. A whole page behaves the same way, producing one voter in 106 seconds.

So the cost per elector is fixed at one model call, and the only lever left is sending fewer
boxes.

Two things the model does that have to be handled rather than hoped away:

*It runs away.* Eleven generations of thirty repeated themselves until the token cap stopped
them. The loop repeats a *complete* record, so the first cycle is kept and the rest discarded;
a response that hit the cap without ever repeating stopped mid-record and is refused outright.

*Its format varies.* The same prompt returns bare pipe-separated fields, the same wrapped in
``<p>``, and table rows padded with ``||``. The fields are found by label rather than by
position, because position is the thing that moves.
