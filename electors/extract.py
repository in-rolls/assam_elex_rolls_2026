"""One part PDF in, one list of electors out.

The unit of work is the **part**, not the page, for two reasons that both come from the data
rather than from convenience. Serial numbers run consecutively through a part and restart at
the next one, so numbering can only be assigned with the whole part in view. And each part
has a published elector total on its info page, so the part is also the smallest unit that
can be *checked* -- which makes it the right thing to cache, retry and resume.

Rendering is the expensive half. ``pdftoppm`` costs about a second a page at 400 dpi, and a
part is thirty-odd pages, so pages are rasterized once in a single invocation and read from
disk rather than re-rendered per field.

#: Everything downstream is calibrated to this. The boxes are ~1000px wide here, which is
#: where the Assamese conjuncts in a name become legible; at 200 dpi they are not.
DPI = 400

#: Bumped whenever extraction changes what a part yields, because the cache is keyed on it.
#: 1.1.0 -- partial last pages, which draw no photo dividers, are no longer discarded whole.
#: 1.2.0 -- supplement pages are labelled instead of merged into the main roll.
#: 1.3.0 -- the roll's own closing totals are read, so counts have a real target.
#: 1.4.0 -- the age line is found by its লিঙ্গ label, recovering the male rows it dropped.
#: 1.5.0 -- the name consensus compares the two scales on the *same band*, so it can disagree.
#:          Bumped despite the cost of discarding 10,245 cached rows: the flag it feeds was
#:          raised zero times under 1.4.0, and a cache mixing the two would report a
#:          disagreement rate that is part real and part an artefact of when a part was read.
#: 1.6.0 -- bands anchor on the relation label rather than counting inwards from the ends, the
#:          two scales are compared once against a measured threshold instead of twice against
#:          two different rules, debris stranded after punctuation is stripped, and an age zone
#:          holding more digits than an age can account for is flagged rather than guessed.
#:
#: Deliberately *not* bumped for the narrowed serial zone. The version exists so a resume does
#: not serve rows produced by code since fixed, and that concern is about data. The serial crop
#: feeds only ``serial_no_ocr`` -- an independent check on the derived row order, itself noisy
#: enough to disagree on most rows -- and no field a consumer reads. Bumping would have thrown
#: away a seventeen-hour constituency to improve a diagnostic, so a 1.6.0 shard may carry
#: serial_no_ocr from either crop and nothing else differs.
#: 1.7.0 -- Latin letters and digits are stripped from names and relations, where they are
#:          scanner debris by definition: the roll prints those fields in Assamese only.
#: 1.8.0 -- relation labels are matched by shape and scored against the three relatives, rather
#:          than enumerated. The enumeration was not converging.
#: 1.9.0 -- repacked English boxes retain their body lines instead of passing through the
#:          Assamese-script header splitter, which discarded every field in AC113.
#: 2.0.0 -- serial numbers continue through supplements instead of restarting at section
#:          boundaries, and sparse supplement pages inherit the preceding addition section.
#: 2.1.0 -- row provenance records the Google Cloud Vision body reader and Tesseract header
#:          reader instead of incorrectly attributing every extracted field to Tesseract.
