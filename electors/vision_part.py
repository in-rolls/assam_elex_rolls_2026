"""Reading a whole part through Cloud Vision.

The tesseract path in :mod:`electors.extract` is built around one page at a time, because that
is the unit tesseract charges for. Vision charges per **image submitted**, so the unit here is
several pages stacked into one tall PNG -- four at 400 dpi -- and a whole part is seven or
eight calls rather than nine hundred process spawns. That is the difference between $1,400 and
$368 for the state, and it is why this is a separate reader rather than an engine slotted into
the existing one.

**No tesseract anywhere in it.** The section header and the closing summary were the two places
the old path still needed a second engine, and Vision has already returned the words for both
by the time they are wanted -- the header sits above the first box, and the summary page is
just another page in the stack. Reading them from words that were already paid for removes the
engine rather than adding a fallback.
