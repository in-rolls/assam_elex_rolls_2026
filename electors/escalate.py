"""Which rows are worth paying more to re-read.

The cheap pass will always leave errors, and pushing it to perfection has sharply diminishing
returns. What makes leaving them acceptable is **knowing which rows they are**, so an
expensive engine runs on those and only those. That makes the detector as important as the
extractor, and it has to be measured before it is trusted.

Two independent families of signal feed it:

``certain``  the floor detectors -- Latin letters in an Assamese name, a name identical to
             the relation, a malformed or duplicated EPIC, a leaked label. These are provably
             wrong without reference to the source.
``doubtful`` the two-scale disagreement flags. Nothing here is known to be wrong; the two
             upscales simply did not produce the same string.

**On measuring this honestly.** Scoring the router's precision against the floor detectors
would be a check that cannot fail: the floor detectors *are* half the router, so it would
report 100% and mean nothing. That trap has already been walked into twice in this stage, so
what is reported here is what can be established without a second opinion -- the volume, and
how much each family contributes on its own -- and precision is left explicitly unmeasured
until an independent engine has read the same rows. :func:`agreement_against` is where that
number comes from once it has.
