"""Reading elector boxes and pages with Gemini, under a schema.

Every engine before this one was parsed out of prose, HTML or pipe-delimited text, and that
parsing was a recurring source of bugs -- a ``<span>`` treated as a line break made a label into
a name, and two copies of one reader drifted apart three separate times. Gemini can be given a
response schema, so the model returns the record already shaped and there is nothing to parse.
That removes the parser as a variable when comparing it against the others.

**Cost, which is the reason it is being considered at all.** Local Surya reads a box in 4.6
seconds, so a pass over one constituency is on the order of 150 hours. The same constituency
through the Batch API is a few dollars and a day of waiting, and the waiting is not this
machine's.

**Failure mode to watch.** Every vision model tried here under-generates confidently: savitr's
distilled model returns one voter for a whole page of thirty and reports nothing wrong. So a
page result is checked for how many electors came back, not only for whether the ones that did
look plausible.

**Send a column, not a page.** Gemini's image tokens are *relative*: it tiles whatever it is
given into a fixed number of crops, so one box and one whole page both cost about 324 input
tokens. A page is thirty times the area, and the detail goes. Measured on the same boxes:

    per box    per column    per page
    name nearly right    80%       80%        20%
    house no right      100%       80%         0%
    age, sex            100%      100%       100%

At page scale it still returns all thirty electors with the right serials, ages and sexes -- and
gives every one of them the same invented surname, ``নৰাৱী`` where the page reads ``নাৰ্জাৰী``,
and no house numbers at all. Confidently wrong at exactly the granularity that looks cheapest.

A grid column (ten boxes) reads as well as a single box and costs a third as much, because the
output tokens dominate and those scale with electors rather than with requests.
