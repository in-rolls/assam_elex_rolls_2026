"""Cutting box images out for a reader that runs somewhere else.

Cloud Vision reads the state, and once it has, **nothing checks it**. There are no labels at
this scale, so the only automatic error signal is two independent engines disagreeing --
dots.ocr is the strongest second reader available and it fails differently, being pure OCR with
no language prior where Vision has one.

It cannot run the state: it reads per box, so 25 million inferences, which is months of free
GPU quota for accuracy it already ties. On a sample it is minutes, and a sample is all a check
needs. That means getting a few thousand box images to a machine with a GPU, which is what this
module is for.

**The filename is the key.** ``p13_pg4_r2c0.png`` is part 13, page 4, box row 2, column 0 --
the same spelling ``dataset/eval`` uses and the same thing :data:`electors.resolution.KEY`
parses. So a folder of crops and a JSON of readings need nothing else to be lined up against
what Vision said about the same boxes; there is no separate manifest to fall out of step.
