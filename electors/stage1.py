"""Stage one: everything the CPU can do, and nothing that costs money.

The pipeline splits at the only expensive step. This stage renders each part, finds the boxes
geometrically from the ruled lines, finds the text lines inside them, reads the three fields
tesseract is good enough for -- the EPIC, the section header and the closing totals -- and packs
the four labelled lines into composites for Cloud Vision.

Everything it produces is what stage two needs and nothing more:

- **composites**, the images Vision is billed for. Repacking cuts a rendered page from 15.5 MP
  to 30% of that, which is 3.3x fewer images: $345 for the state against about $105.
- **placements**, every tile's rectangle inside its composite. Vision answers in the composite's
  coordinates and a word has to come back to the box it was cut from; without this, stage two
  would have to re-derive the geometry and could silently disagree with the geometry that
  produced the image.
- **a manifest**, one row per tile carrying ac, part, page, box, band, rectangle, section and
  the source sha, so a reading can be put in the right row and traced to exact source bytes.
- **side reads**, the EPIC and serial per box and the part's printed closing total, which is the
  only number in the source that the extracted rows can be measured against.

It costs about 142 ms of CPU per box -- 985 core-hours for all 126 constituencies, roughly $8 of
spot CPU or five days on a laptop -- and nothing at all in API charges.

#: Bumped whenever stage one changes what it writes, because ``done`` is keyed on it.
#:
#: The concern is data, not code. ``done`` proved a part had been prepared, never *by what*, so
#: a resume happily served side reads produced before a fix -- twice in one evening. Once when
#: composites on disk let a rerun skip parts whose EPICs were still at 62%, and again when a new
#: instance pulled that same output back out of the bucket and reported "resumed with 111 parts
#: already prepared". Both were caught by reading a log line, which is not a control.
#:
#: ``extract.PIPELINE_VERSION`` does exactly this for the row cache and is why that cache has
#: never had the same problem.
#:
#: 2.0.0 -- the EPIC and serial are read from their own cells rather than one strip pass, and a
#:          struck-off entry's status code is recorded.
#: 2.1.0 -- a section marker must be a whole word outside the station-name field, a partial
#:          page's second row is no longer rejected by a gutter estimated from header rules,
#:          and all of a part's columns are built with ink deciding which hold an elector.
#:          Together these recovered 625 rows in AC1 that reconciliation had reported missing.
#: 2.2.0 -- a status code must be one of the five the roll defines in its own legend.
#: 2.3.0 -- a closing page tesseract could not read is kept, so stage two can spend on it.
#: 2.4.0 -- the Bengali genitive section titles (সংযোজনের তালিকা) classify as supplements, and the
#:          Bengali র is accepted where only the Assamese ৰ was. AC126's sections were written by
#:          the older classifier and are exactly the stale output this gate exists to invalidate.
#: 2.5.0 -- section markers have a left word boundary, so -বাদ in place names is not a deletion,
#:          and sparse continuation pages inherit an addition section.
#: 2.6.0 -- section headers and closing summaries use the source roll's declared language;
#:          English pages are no longer sent through the Assamese OCR model.
#: 2.7.0 -- a single ruled elector row is recovered, and an English closing table whose rules
#:          resemble elector boxes is identified by its explicit title instead of emitted.
#: 2.8.0 -- a page whose three detected text columns have impossible unequal widths inherits
#:          the part's established geometry; stray vertical rules no longer become dividers.
#: 2.9.0 -- cached serial, EPIC, and status reads require both identical source bytes and an
#:          identical crop rectangle; a geometry repair cannot retain reads from the old box.
