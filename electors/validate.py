"""Checking the electors against the answer key the source already published.

Most OCR pipelines can only report how confident they feel. This one does not have to. Every
part's info page states how many electors it contains, split by sex, and that arithmetic was
verified across all 31,486 parts when ``dataset/parts.jsonl.gz`` was built. So each part
arrives with a published count of what this stage should produce.

**But that figure is a net, and the printed roll does not equal it.** Part 1 prints 870
entries against a published 850, part 9 prints 810 against 791 -- with no supplement pages, no
blank boxes, and no deletion marking anywhere in the ink (min 0.086, median 0.108, max 0.138:
one tight population). The gap is in the publisher's arithmetic -- deletions counted but not
reprinted -- and is not recoverable from these PDFs. Treating "extracted == published" as the
target would mean deleting real rows until a number that cannot be right looks right.

So the checks are separated by what each can actually prove:

``serial``     serials run 1..N within each list, no gaps. Ordering and numbering are
               intact. This is checkable from the data alone.
``sex``        the male/female split against the published one. A *ratio* check: it caught a
               matcher that returned 41/59 against a published 51/49, which no count would
               have shown.
``published``  printed entries minus the published net, reported **as a difference with an
               outlier band** rather than as pass/fail. A part diverging far more than its
               neighbours is worth looking at; a part diverging like its neighbours is the
               publisher's arithmetic, not a defect.

Field-level checks follow the shape used in ``parse_unsearchable_rolls`` -- types, ranges and
field sizes. They say a value is *plausible*; nothing here says the extraction is complete,
because the source does not publish a number that would establish it.
