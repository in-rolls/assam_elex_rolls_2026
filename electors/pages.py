"""Which page is which, decided by what is ruled on it rather than by its number.

A part PDF is three kinds of page in sequence: the two info pages already parsed into
``dataset/parts.jsonl.gz``, then the elector pages, then a summary. Page *count* varies with
how many electors a part has, so only the first two positions are fixed and everything else
has to be recognised.

Recognising it by rule signature rather than by position is not fussiness. The info-page
pipeline was scoped as "ACs 64-73" from a one-page-per-AC sample and turned out to be 28 ACs
and 2,601 pages once every page was measured; layout in this corpus varies more than a
sample suggests. Only one AC of rolls is downloadable today, so any constant read off AC 1
is a guess about the other 125.

The signature is robust because it is structural:

    elector page   a grid can be built from its rules  ->  columns and rows both resolve
    summary page   ruled rows, no columns              ->  no vertical rules
    info page      the form grid                       ->  positions 1 and 2, always

An unrecognised page is **flagged, never parsed**. A page this module cannot classify is a
page whose geometry we do not understand, and guessing at 30 box positions on it would
produce 30 plausible rows of nonsense.
