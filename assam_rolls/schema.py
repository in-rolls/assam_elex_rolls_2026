"""Schema for Assam 2026 electoral roll info pages.

Single source of truth for three things that must never drift apart:

1. ``PART_COLUMNS`` / ``SECTION_COLUMNS`` -- the CSV output headers.
2. ``PAGE1_JSON_SCHEMA`` -- the JSON Schema handed to Claude's structured outputs,
   which guarantees the response parses without regex salvage.
3. ``parse_source_filename`` -- recovers the AC and part number from the PDF filename.
   The publisher encodes both in every filename, so they are independently-known
   ground truth on every page at zero labeling cost (see ``validate.py``).

Text conventions
----------------
Assamese text is stored **verbatim**, including Assamese numerals where the source
uses them (``ps_address`` reads ``৫৯০ বনগাঁও এল. পি. স্কুল, কঠা নং ১, বনগাঁও``).
Each such field has a ``*_roman`` companion holding a model-produced romanization.
The verbatim column is the archival record; ``*_roman`` is a convenience for joining
and is explicitly model-generated -- it is scored separately from the verbatim fields
because transliteration has no single correct answer.

The three categorical fields are normalized to a controlled English vocabulary rather
than transliterated, so they can be filtered on directly.
