"""Cross-engine field-level benchmark.

Modelled on ``parse_unsearchable_rolls/scripts/manipur/benchmark/score.py``. Every engine
is driven through the **same** grid detection and the same field parser, so the numbers
isolate OCR quality rather than parsing.

**These are agreement figures, not accuracy figures.** There is no human-labelled gold
set here: a candidate is scored on how often it matches a *declared reference* engine.
The Manipur benchmark did the same thing and said so plainly ("the share of each field
that exactly matches Surya"). Where reference and candidate share a failure they will
agree and both be wrong, so a high score is a necessary but not sufficient condition.

Three metrics per field, mirroring the ``name`` / ``name_nospace`` / ``name_charsim``
split used there, adapted to Assamese:

``exact``
    byte-equal after Unicode NFC normalisation and whitespace collapse.
``skeleton``
    compares with all combining marks stripped, so a misplaced diacritic (গাঁও/গাওঁ)
    counts as a match while a wrong letter does not -- the same job ``name_nospace``
    does for ALL-CAPS spacing in the Manipur benchmark.
``charsim``
    mean character-level similarity, so near-misses are visible rather than binary.

    Engines disagree about diacritic **placement** -- গাঁও versus গাওঁ, where the

    codepoint sequences (গ া ঁ ও vs গ া ও ঁ), so no amount of reordering within a cluster
    makes them equal; only dropping the marks does.

    Comparing skeletons therefore separates "right letters, misplaced diacritic" from
    "wrong letter", which is the distinction that matters when judging an engine:

        গাঁও   vs গাওঁ       -> same skeleton  (recoverable placement artifact)
        কোকৰাঝাৰ vs কোকৰাব্মাৰ -> different     (a real misread, ঝ became ব্ম)

    This is the Assamese analogue of the ``name_nospace`` metric in the Manipur
    benchmark, which isolated an ALL-CAPS spacing artifact the same way.
