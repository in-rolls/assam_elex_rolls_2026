"""Turn a detected grid plus an OCR engine into schema rows.

Every field is read from a cell whose position is known, so the parser never has to
recognise a label to find a value. Two structures recur and are handled positionally:

* **Stacked label/value blocks** (section 1's revision details, section 2's locality
  block) are split into text rows by ink profile, then each row is cropped to the value
  column. Field identity comes from the **row index**, not from reading the label --
  Tesseract mangles labels (``ব্লক`` becomes ``বক``) and sometimes reads the colon as
  ``£``, both of which would break a text-based split.
* **Wrapped values.** The polling-station name is printed under its label, so it lands
  in the ``s3_address`` cell rather than ``s3_ps_name``; the address follows its own
  label row. Both are addressed by row index within that cell.

Numbers are only ever read with ``read_digits`` from digit-only crops -- see ``ocr`` for
why mixing the Assamese model into number reading corrupts results silently.
