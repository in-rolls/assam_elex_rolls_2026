"""Recover the info-page table grid from ruled lines -- no OCR, no language model.

Page 1 is a machine-generated form, so its rules land on the same pixels every time.
Measured across AC1, AC10, AC12 and AC100:

* horizontal rules at ``124, 157, 191, 225, 399, 433, 483, 816, 850, 896`` are present on
  every page, pixel-identical;
* the section-4 elector table is always the **last five** rules, with fixed relative
  spacing (``+34, +80, +116, +170``);
* its six columns sit at ``24, 156, 286, 497, 723, 947, 1162``, identical within 1px.

Two page variants exist. Some pages carry an extra rule around y=171, and the section-3
address block is 26px taller when the address wraps to a second line -- which shifts
everything below it. So cells are addressed by **detected structure** (stable rules from
the top, the elector table from the end), never by hardcoded absolute offsets.

Recovering the grid mechanically means label text never has to be read: the pipeline
knows where each value lives and OCRs only that cell. That is what makes a free,
local-only pipeline viable.
