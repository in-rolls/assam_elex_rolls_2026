"""Re-encode rendered pages as greyscale, in place, losslessly.

The source PDFs are bilevel scans. Every page in ``out/pages`` carries R == G == B on every
pixel, so two of the three channels are exact copies and cost a third of the file each. The
renderers now pass ``-gray`` to ``pdftoppm`` so this stops being produced; this is for the
31,486 pages already on disk.

**Lossless is checked, not assumed.** A page whose channels are not identical is left alone and
counted, because converting it would be a real loss rather than a saving. On this corpus nothing
has ever failed that test, which is exactly why it is worth keeping -- the check costs a read
that is happening anyway, and the day it fires is the day the assumption stopped holding.

Written to a temporary file and renamed over the original, so an interruption leaves either the
old page or the new one and never a truncated one.
