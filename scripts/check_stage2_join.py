"""Prove stage two files every word in the box it came from, without spending anything.

The pixel check in ``electors.verify`` proves the *image* is right: every tile in a composite is
byte-identical to its source page. It says nothing about what happens after Vision answers, and
that is where the remaining risk is -- Vision replies in the composite's coordinates, and a word
in tile 200 has to come back to page 14, box (3, 1).

So this feeds stage two a synthetic reply instead of a real one: for every tile, a full elector
box whose name is that tile's own position. If the join is right, the row for page 14 box (3, 1)
reads back the name minted for page 14 box (3, 1) and no other. A mapping that is off by one tile,
or that hands a word to all three tiles in its row, fails on almost every box rather than subtly.

Free, exact, and it runs over every tile rather than a sample.
