"""Match a native value to an official English name, within a scope small enough to be safe.

Fuzzy matching a name against a national gazetteer is a good way to produce confident
nonsense. What makes it defensible here is that every match is **scoped by a key the corpus
already carries**: a post office is compared only against the offices sharing its pincode --
a median of twelve candidates, not 155,000. At that size the question stops being "what does
this say" and becomes "which of these twelve is it", which edit distance can answer.

Two preparations are needed before the comparison is even meaningful.

**Strip the generic suffix.** ``বচদ্ৰৱা অংশ`` romanizes to *Batadrava Ansh*, and the
gazetteer says *Batadrava*. A first probe scored these as failures purely because of the
suffix, so the value is reduced to its **core** -- the tokens that are not administrative
vocabulary -- before matching, and the suffix is put back afterwards.

**Repair the model's artifacts.** ``xalbari`` cannot match *Salbari* until the ``x`` is dealt
with (see ``normalize``).

A match replaces only the core. ``ৰহা অংশ`` becomes *Raha Ansh*, never *Raha* -- the official
source is an authority on the place name, not a licence to drop what the roll printed.
