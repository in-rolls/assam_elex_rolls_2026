"""Repair of IndicXlit's systematic artifacts. Model output only, never reviewed text.

IndicXlit renders Assamese **phonetics**, and two of its habits are wrong in every English
context this dataset will be joined against:

``x`` for শ / ষ / স
    Assamese pronounces all three as /x/, so the model writes ``xalbari``, ``xapotgram``,
    ``boxistho`` where English has always written *Salbari*, *Sapatgram*, *Basistha*. This is
    not a judgement call: of 1,831 cached tokens whose output contains ``x``, **1,830** have
    শ, ষ or স in the source. The one exception is ``৷৷``, pure OCR noise.

``aa`` for a single আ
    ``aambari``, ``aajij``, ``aaloga``. English doubles that vowel in almost no Assam place
    name.

Both together are worth 13,578 token-occurrences and gain +2.7 points on the hand-checked
gold set. That gain is small because exact-match is a harsh measure of a change whose real
effect is legibility: ``salbari`` is not certainly the conventional spelling, but it is never
worse than ``xalbari`` and a reader can recognise it.

**``z`` is deliberately left alone.** য/জ do surface as *j* conventionally (*Jorhat* for
``zurhat``), but applying ``z``→``j`` scored **-0.3 points**: it corrupts as many tokens as it
fixes. A rule that does not survive its own measurement does not ship.

The other repairs here are OCR debris the transliterator faithfully carried through: the
Bengali danda ``৷`` (U+09F7) sits inside the script-run range and was being handed to a word
transliterator, and zero-width joiners survive into the output invisibly.
