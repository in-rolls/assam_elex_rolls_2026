"""What may be published, and what may not.

The old rule was exact-or-nothing: one missing row discarded a constituency. Measured on AC8 that
meant throwing away 231,131 rows to avoid 28, and at a 99.4% per-part match rate a 232-part
constituency cleared the bar about a quarter of the time -- which is what a queue stuck at fifty
looks like from outside.

An absolute five-row per-part bar was tried next and repeated the mistake at a higher altitude:
AC24, one part in 177 off by nine rows out of 738, was still discarded whole. Both cases are
pinned below with their real numbers, because the temptation each time was to move the bar until
the thing in front of me passed, and the only defence against that is measured cases in a test.

The rule that survives: whole parts going missing is caught upstream against the published part
count; here a part may be mangled but not badly mangled, and the constituency's total shortfall is
capped as a proportion.
